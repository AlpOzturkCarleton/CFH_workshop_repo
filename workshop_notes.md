 This is what we have been looking at today so far:
- Basic computational thinking
    - Switching the intuitive and logical mind
- Markdowns
- **Scary** *Miniconda* errors

Which leads me to code the most basic of basic python codes:

`print("Hello World");`

I also learned about unsplash, very cool!
